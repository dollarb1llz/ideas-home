            Thought of a good schedule for Twitch.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use phone to stream a bit in the forest, then go inside to live stream writing the daily blog / updating website.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can also stream the morning stretch.
          </li>
          <li>
            You could set up the mic we have and use the macbook for the webcam. Looking to getting a webcam for the pc and a mechanical keyboard possibly one that lights up.
          </li>
          <li>
            Basically came to the thought that maybe I'm not striving to be the most entertaining person on the web, but at least I will be "A person on the web" and a person that I want to be. And we will see what happens.
          </li>
          <li>
            I look forward to ways of updating websites using git or remotely through git.
          </li>
          <li>
            Might change the layout of this page to a paragraph page and add shap-outside css to it. Hell yea.
          </li>
          <li>
            Also want to mark my keyboard somehow like i did at the office
          </li>
          <li>
            Thinking I might reset the wweeks ideas after sunday.
          </li>
          <li>
            I think this site has the potential to really get my brain on paper in a way.
          </li>
          <li>
            I will have stuff that makes me think, laugh and cry. That's why I am thinking about putting a page with daily updates on myself and herbs/ medicine.
          </li>
          <li>
            This webpage will just be a portal into my mind. Keeping my life organized on this page.
          </li>
          <li>
            I want to figure out the fav.ico maan

            Lets setup the the second speaker and use the aux cable to the computer instead of bluetuuth
          </li>
          <li>
            Spend time everyday to look through pictures to find media for the content on my webpage.

            So tired of over eating; The feeling in my stomach, it hurts so much and I do it to myself.
          </li>
          <li class="strike op">
            Been supporting many people and it gives you that fear to make more money. Pushes you in  a way.

            To have a friend out there who you can conquer the world with. Richard.

            Discipline. Find the will to do the things that make you feel successful and success will find it's way to you.

          <li class="strike op">
            Feel like really embracing oils more and more and wanting to go and ask people if they would like to try some.
          </li>
          <li class="strike op">
            Feels like I found my theme yesterday in the forest. Less is more. I feel it's my voice to sit still and do nothing in the forest. Make comments on things that appear in the now.
            <img src="./res/img/forests.jpg" />
          </li>
          <li class="strike op">
            I wonder how you put Gifs on webpages
          </li>

            Trying to figure out my Twitch schedule. It's very confusing but I trust the process.
          </li>
          <li class="strike op">
            I like the idea of staying active on all the social media platforms. But should'nt there be more of a presence on one of them? I feel like Twitch should be the Main platform.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hmm.. how about dedicate the forest time for twitch, and when I'm away on twitch, the other platforms are for when I have time throughout the day.
          </li>
          <li class="strike op">
            <img src="./res/img/thinker.jpg" />
            And instead of posting my twitch streams on youtube, maybe i can do different style vids. Like how to's and questions. Like youtube should be more personal I feel. Hmm.. actually, approach youtube the same as like instagram. When there's something cool and it's not forest time, record it or go live.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the other platforms to connect with people, to say hi. And you can't say hi for 3 hours so lol.
          </li>
          <li class="strike op">
            I'm jumping on board with Richard. we got this.
